                    <p class="p-text">&emsp;Hello there! I am currently a Senior in undergraduate Computer Engineering at <a class="text-link" href="https://catalog.fit.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=18&poid=7273">Florida Tech</a>. 
                        I am an Eagle Scout from Troop 451 located in Lusby, MD. 
                        Professionally, my interests include working with microcontrollers, robotics, and space exploration. 
                        Leisurely, I am an avid fan of all things superheroes and board games.  
                        Recently I have been working on becoming a part of the maker community, where I will be sharing my projects
                        related to software, hardware, and 3D printing. I hope that you choose to follow me on my maker journey!

                    <p class="p-text">&emsp;I was raised by two electrical engineering parents who inspired my love and interest in engineering. 
                        My Papa was a lead engineer for NASA during the Apollo and Shuttle eras, and he sparked my love and admiration for exploration through the vastness of space. 
                        I have been involved in robotics from FIRST Lego League, HS VEX, VEX U, and projects throughout college. 
                        I was involved with BSA Scouting from the age of 7 to 18, where I learned leadership, perseverance, and the importance of helping others. 
                        I progressed through the ranks to Eagle Scout, and while doing so, my love for nature, hiking, travel, and photography grew. 
                        For a few years in middle and high school, I aspired to be a film director and directed several of my own short films. 
                        From an early age, Superheroes have not just been an escape for me but have guided my moral compass towards compassion for others and the desire to always help others and show kindness.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="p-text">&emsp;For years, I have watched Mark Rober, The Hacksmith, and The King of Random in awe of their cool projects. 
                        I visited my first Maker Faire in 2023. 
                        Then, after a research assistant role didn't work out for the summer, I decided it was finally time to challenge myself, pursue my own maker projects, and document the process as a content creator. 
                        With college winding down and plenty of courses under my belt, I can begin applying myself in something that I can express all my interests combined into one. 
                        I take this leap of faith in hopes of one day being able to help others around me through the gizmos I make and the pursuit to challenge themselves.

                    <p class="p-text">&emsp;While pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering, my core classes involve topics in electrical and computer science. 
                        Through my computer engineering courses, I have become familiar with circuit design and analysis, C++, introductory full-stack web development, and Low-level programming of Arduino and Raspberry Pi. 
                        My curiosity for learning doesn't stop there; I have taken numerous courses in Aerospace Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. 
                        For Aerospace Engineering, I have taken 2 of the core courses of the major, Control Systems, and this fall, I will be taking Space Vehicle Control. 
                        This past semester, I took a Mechanical Engineering graduate-level course in Advanced Mechatronics, which extended my knowledge from Computer Engineering courses. 
                        In the course, I applied the topics previously briefly went over and then introduced me to work with a broader range of components, motor control, and motor system identification through several projects. 
                        This fall, I will take another graduate-level Mechanical Engineering course in Instrumentation.  
                        I have also taken an introductory course in Space Sciences. 
                        I am a member of a mechanical engineering senior design team tasked to design a flexible end effector to be integrated and tested using a Stretch 2 by Hello Robot.

                    <br>
                    <p class="p-text">&emsp;I was a lead programmer on the Vex U team at Florida Tech for the first two and a half years before my other research and classes took up most of my time. 
                        In Vex robotics, I programmed both driver and autonomous control of one of the competition robots, applied odometry and PID control, and assisted others in learning to program the robots. 
                        As an assistant researcher, I assisted a PhD candidate from the Autonomy Lab at Florida Tech in her research of characterizing unknown non-cooperative spacecraft. 
                        I assisted with writing Python code to develop superquadrics datasets to analyze familiarity with satellite components and develop algorithms to perform histogram analysis of variance in pixel data.
